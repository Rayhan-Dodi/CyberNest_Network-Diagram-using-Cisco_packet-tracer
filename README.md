# CyberNest - Network Diagram using Cisco Packet Tracer

Welcome to the **CyberNest** project! This repository contains a complete network diagram simulation created using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The project demonstrates a small to medium-sized enterprise-level network setup, with a focus on basic routing, switching, IP addressing, and network topology.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a networking course or self-study to enhance understanding of:

- Network topologies
- IP addressing and subnetting
- Device configuration (routers, switches, PCs, etc.)
- Static routing and/or dynamic routing protocols
- Inter-VLAN routing
- Basic network security principles

---

## üìÅ Files Included

- `CyberNest_Network_Diagram.pkt`: The main Cisco Packet Tracer project file containing the full network diagram.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## üß† What You Will Learn

By exploring this project, you can learn:

- How to design a structured network topology
- Assigning IP addresses and subnetting
- Router and switch configuration
- Connecting and testing end devices (PCs, servers)
- Implementing basic routing

---

## üß∞ Tools Used

- **Cisco Packet Tracer** (Version 8.x or above recommended)
- Basic knowledge of networking concepts (CCNA level or equivalent)

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Network Topology Overview

The simulated network includes:

- Multiple PCs and switches
- At least one router for inter-network communication
- Proper IP addressing scheme
- Functional end-to-end connectivity
